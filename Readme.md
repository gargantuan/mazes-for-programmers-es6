# Mazes for programmers
## Examples in ES6*

[Mazes for Programmers (Pragmatic Bookshelf)](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) is a fantastic book and an even better resource. The examples in the book are written in Ruby. As I work through the examples, I'll be porting them to Javascript, ES6. It's not quite as elegant or concise a ruby, but it's not quite as ugly or convoluted as ES5 either.

* I'm using class property initializers, so it's technically ES7.
